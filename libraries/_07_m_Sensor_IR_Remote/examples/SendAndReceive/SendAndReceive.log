START ../src/SendAndReceive.cpp from Feb 24 2023
Using library version 4.1.0
Ready to receive IR signals of protocols: NEC/NEC2/Onkyo/Apple, Universal Pulse Distance Width, at pin 2
Send IR signals at pin 3
Send signal mark duration is 8 us, pulse correction is 3000 ns, total period is 26 us
5000 us is the (minimum) gap, after which the start of a new IR packet is assumed
20 us are subtracted from all marks and added to all spaces for decoding
